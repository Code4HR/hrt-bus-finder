hrt-bus-finder
==============

The HRT Bus Finder is the front end / proof-of-concept to the [hrt-bus-api] (https://github.com/c4hrva/hrt-bus-api). The live demo can be found here: http://hrtb.us. 

Requirements
============

The front end is developed using the following:

+ [BackboneJS] (http://backbonejs.org/)
  + also requires [jQuery] (http://jquery.com/) and [UnderscoreJS] (http://underscorejs.org/)
+ [Twitter Bootstrap] (http://getbootstrap.com/)
+ and the [Google Maps Api] (https://developers.google.com/maps/)


About the API
=============

The [hrt-bus-api] (https://github.com/c4hrva/hrt-bus-api) is a mash-up of two sources provided by [Hampton Roads Transport (HRT)] (http://www.gohrt.com/). Their bus scheduling information, which is published to [General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS)] (http://www.gtfs-data-exchange.com/agency/hampton-roads-transit-hrt/) and their in-transit routing information which is provided via an alternate source. These two sets of data are pulled into the API and processed, allowing en-route bus tracking.  

Front End Development
=====================

The hrt-bus-finder runs entirely in the browser. As such, development requires nothing more than an Internet connection and the ability to clone this repository. All dependencies have been included.
